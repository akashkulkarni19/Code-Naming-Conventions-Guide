# Project Overview: Code Naming Conventions Guide

This project serves as a centralized reference for naming conventions used across programming languages. It provides a structured, example-rich guide to help developers, teams, and educators enforce consistent and professional coding styles.

## Goals
- Explain different casing styles used in codebases
- Provide language-specific recommendations
- Encourage readability, maintainability, and standardization
- Support onboarding, learning, and documentation practices

## Sections
- `README.md`: Main documentation with cheat sheet
- `LICENSE`: MIT license for open contributions
- `.gitignore`: Keeps repo clean from system and temp files
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributors
- `casing-examples/`: Folder with dedicated examples and usage notes per casing style

## How to Use
Refer to `README.md` for quick reference or dive into the `casing-examples/` folder to understand each naming pattern with practical examples and best-use cases.
